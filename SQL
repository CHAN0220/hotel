select people from the "Persons" table to start with "L", then an arbitrary character, then "n", then any character, and then "on"



 

SQL BETWEEN statement

select people between "Adams" (included) and "Carter" (not included) in alphabetical order



select people outside the range, use the NOT operator



SQL JOIN statement

Different SQL JOIN

In addition to the INNER JOIN we used in the example above, we can also use several other joins.

The types of JOINs you can use and the differences between them are listed below.
•JOIN: If there is at least one match in the table, return rows
•LEFT JOIN: return all rows from the left table even if there is no match in the right table
•RIGHT JOIN: return all rows from the right table even if there is no match in the left table
•FULL JOIN: return a row as long as there is a match in one of the tables

JOIN



LEFT JOIN



RIGHT JOIN



FULL JOIN(ERROR)



(Resolve)



SQL COUNT() function

The COUNT () function returns the number of rows that match the specified criteria



SQL GROUP BY statement

       Aggregate functions (such as SUM) often require the addition of a GROUP BY statement

GROUP BY statement is used in combination with aggregate functions to group result sets based on one or more columns



SQL HAVING statement

The reason for adding the HAVING clause to SQL is that the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions
